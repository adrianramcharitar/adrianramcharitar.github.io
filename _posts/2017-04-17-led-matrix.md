For a class project, our team wanted to promote healthy living as well as positive exercise. We came up with the idea of having a wrist worn LED matrix that lights up according to a persons exercise habits. The wearable uses a heartbeat sensor to detect the wearer's heart rate and flashes the LED matrix accordingly with several different patterns to let the wearer know if they've approached their target heart rate and motivates them to keep exercising.
